# Context

Created during my Level 4 Games Development course, this short demo serves as a proof of concept for a much larger scale project *River Restoration*. 

This simple 3D project significantly deepened my understanding of Unity, particularly in areas like UI and image capturing.

# Assets

All code was written by me, with some additional support from my tutors.

The 3D models were sourced from the Unity Asset Store.
